# ZeroTrois
ZeroTrois engine is a game engine that I am developping and continuation of https://github.com/Tnkln99/Engine_03.
All of these applications that I will present down below ( you can find their code in this repo ) is developped with "ZeroTrois". Graphics part of the engine uses Vulkan Api, it has prewritten rendering systems that waits the application to add entities to render. All the apps uses ECS that I implemented in the engine.
